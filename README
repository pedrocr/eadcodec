This is an EAD importer/exporter lib. Basic usage should be pretty simple. 
Importing EAD files stuffs ruby objects with the values in the file. Exporting 
does the opposite.

To import a file just do:

  ead = EAD::EADDocument.from_file('some_ead_file.xml')

All the file will be imported and it's whole contents loaded into memory. For 
big files this is a problem so you should look at 
XMLUtils::XMLStreamObjectParser instead.

The XMLUtils module has some nice utility classes and functions to handle any 
kind of XML file. XMLUtils::XMLElement can be used to define an importer and 
exporter for any XML format. XMLUtils::XMLStreamObjectParser is designed to work
with it allowing for stream parsing of XML files of arbitrary length with 
constant memory usage while still treating elements as ruby objects.
